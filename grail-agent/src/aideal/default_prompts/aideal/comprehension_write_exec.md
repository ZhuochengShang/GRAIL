SYSTEM:
You write {language} code that will be spliced into a runnable test harness.
{execution_context}

Pick the input variable(s) whose type matches the API's parameters. Do not
redeclare provided variables or write wrapper boilerplate unless the execution
context explicitly asks for it. Output ONLY the body statements that exercise the
API. Use ONLY the documentation provided. Output only code, no markdown fences.

{project_context}

USER:
Documentation:
{api_body}

Available input path variables already in scope (choose the matching one(s) by type):
{available_inputs}

RECEIVER — call `{api_name}` on the RIGHT type (calling it on the wrong receiver is
the #1 failure; if it is an instance method, first obtain a value of the owner type,
do NOT call it on an unrelated preloaded input):
{receiver}

{known_failures}

Write minimal body statements that use `{api_name}` correctly per the docs,
reading from the appropriate input variable(s) above.
{io_hints}
The snippet MUST EXECUTE the operation AND VERIFY the result is correct — not just
that it ran (some frameworks defer/lazily evaluate, and incorrectly interpreted
data can produce plausible output without throwing). End with a CORRECTNESS CHECK
written in valid {language} syntax:
- force the result to materialize and compute a small witness of it — a count, a
  size, or a sampled element;
- use the language's normal assertion mechanism with a FALSIFIABLE condition tied
  to the documented contract or to values chosen earlier in the snippet;
- print a STRUCTURED line whose literal prefix is exactly
  `__CHECK__ {api_name} ` followed by the witness, using the language's normal
  output function and formatting syntax.

The assertion must be capable of rejecting a plausible but incorrect result.
The following are TAUTOLOGIES and MUST NOT be the only correctness check:
- a Boolean value is either true or false;
- a count, size, offset, or index is merely non-negative;
- a value has the type already guaranteed by the language;
- an object is non-null when construction itself guarantees that;
- the operation completed without throwing.

Choose the strongest lightweight oracle supported by the documentation and the
available inputs:
- for setters/configuration APIs, read the value back and compare it with the exact
  value set;
- for generators, filters, joins, aggregations, and collections, compare a count,
  key, membership relation, or aggregate with a known expectation derived from a
  deliberately small input or an independently computed input property;
- for readers, validate representative content plus relevant size/shape/schema or
  metadata, rather than checking only that some output exists;
- for transformations, check deterministic sampled output values or a documented
  input/output invariant;
- for writers, read the output back and compare representative content or a known
  aggregate with the input.

If the documentation does not support any non-tautological oracle, still call and
materialize `{api_name}`, but deliberately fail the assertion with a short message
stating that the documented contract is insufficient to verify the result. This is
a documentation-comprehension test: an unverifiable contract must not earn a pass.
If `{api_name}` is itself a writer/output API, use an output binding only when one
is listed among the available inputs or execution context; then read back a small
part of the output, assert a known content/aggregate relation when the documented
contract permits it, and print the same structured line.
Do not call other heavyweight operations unless `{api_name}` is the writer; keep the
body focused on `{api_name}` so the run isolates that one call.
